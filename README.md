# Pig-Game
- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result gets added to his ROUND score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1 with any of the 2 dice, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. This is called 'BUST'.
- IF the player rolls a 6 with any die back to back, That player will lose their entire GLOBAL score. This is called 'BROKE'. There is one exception here, you can roll 2 6's on one turn and not 'BROKE' but if you still roll a 6 on any die the turn after you will.
- The player can choose to 'HOLD', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game
- Players can choose to set the the GLOBAL score by typing a number into the input box and clicking SUBMIT.
